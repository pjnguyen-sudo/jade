# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to projects, GitHub is a centralized platform that holds all Git repositories, and Git Bash is a command line tool that allows Git to be used on Windows.

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# The terminal is an interface that runs a shell, and the command line is a synonym for terminal. The main difference would be that "terminal" is more so used for Mac while "command line" is for Windows.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# Windows PowerShell is different from Git Bash because Powershell is usually used for configuration management while Git Bash is better for traditional development.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# Anaconda is a software used to install and mangage programming languages, conda is a packet and environment manager that comes with Anaconda, and Python is a programming language that can be distributed under Anaconda.

# 5) What is VS Code? 
# VS Code, or Visual Studio Code, is an integrated development environment and code editor.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# A Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing program that can display code, the outputs of the code, and commentary about the code. It is different from Jupyter Lab because Jupyter Lab allows a user to open multiple notebooks, acting more like a user interface.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# "~/" means starting from root directory and is short for the current user's home folder.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# An absolute path is the full path from the root, while a relative path is dependent on the current directory.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute: /Users/willkirtles/Python_DeCal_Fall25/course_assignments/homework2
# Relative: /jade/course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# "cd -"

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# "rm ./" would remove the contents of your entire root directory, which would include your current directory too.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add --> selects file and moves it to the staging area, marking it as included in the next commit
# git commit --> saves, or "commits", the file to the local repository
# git push --> pushes the commit from a local repository to a remote repository

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# "git add ." adds the entire directory into the commit, including those beginning with ".", while "git add <file>" specifically commits that directory.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# "git status" shows the status of the working tree, and "git log -1" returns the most recent commit on a branch.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# Cloning a repository gets a copy of an existing local repository while pulling a repository is editing that copy with a new commit.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# I don't think I've had any bugs/errors in this class so far. Outside of class, though, I was trying to use some old code to edit something for a club, but I quickly realized that I needed certain files for it to run, which I didn't have, so I couldn't do anything with it.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# I guess I'm just curious as to how this all translates into a physical image. Right now, all we've been working on so far (or at least that I've been doing) is purely textual, so it makes me interested in how you'd make, for example, a game from lines of code. 

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# I go to Zhangliang Malatang at least once a week.

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(10>=2) # This expression indicates that 10 is greater than or equal to 2, and running it in terminal indicates that it is true.
